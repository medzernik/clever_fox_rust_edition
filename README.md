# clever_fox_rust_edition
Rust edition of the Discord Bot CleverFox

This is a Rust edition of my CleverFox Bot for Discord. I experiment with various features and eventually I want to reach feature and archtectural parity. Some architectural design choices may get implemented into the Go edition and some retrofitted for the Rust edition.

The architectural design is currently going to be very simple while I get the grasp of Rust and the bot library, eventually a complete rewrite could happen.
